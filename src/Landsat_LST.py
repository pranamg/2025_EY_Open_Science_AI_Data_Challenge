# ## EY Data Challenge - Landsat Land Surface Temperature
# 
# This sample notebook can be used to create a Landsat Land Surface Temperature (LST) product. The notebook creates a cloud-filtered median mosaic for any time period and location and then creates the LST product. A median mosaic reflects the "median" value of pixels for all spectral bands in the time series. When scenes within a time series contain clouds, the use of a median calculation can statistically remove clouds from the final median mosaic product, assuming there are plenty of clear pixels within the time series. The baseline data is [Landsat Collection-2 Level-2](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2) data from the MS Planetary Computer catalog.

# 
# First, we define our area of interest using latitude and longitude coordinates. 

# %%
# Define the bounding box for the entire data region using (Latitude, Longitude)
# This is the region of New York City that contains our temperature dataset
lower_left = (40.75, -74.01)
upper_right = (40.88, -73.86)

# %%
# Calculate the bounds for doing an archive data search
# bounds = (min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat)
bounds = (lower_left[1], lower_left[0], upper_right[1], upper_right[0])

# %%
# Define the time window
# We will use a period of 3 months to search for data
time_window = "2021-06-01/2021-09-01"

# Using the `pystac_client` we can search the Planetary Computer's STAC endpoint for items matching our query parameters. The query searches for "low cloud" scenes with overall cloud cover <20%. We will also limit our search to Landsat-8 to avoid the Landsat-7 scan line corrector failure. The result is the number of scenes matching our search criteria that touch our area of interest. Some of these may be partial scenes or contain clouds.

# Next, we'll load the data into an [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) DataArray using [stackstac](https://stackstac.readthedocs.io/). We will only keep the commonly used spectral bands (Red, Green, Blue, NIR, Surface Temperature). There are also several other <b>important settings for the data</b>: We have changed the projection to epsg=4326 which is standard latitude-longitude in degrees. We have specified the spatial resolution of each pixel to be 30-meters. 

# %%
signed_items = [planetary_computer.sign(item).to_dict() for item in items]

# %%
# Define the pixel resolution for the final product
# Define the scale according to our selected crs, so we will use degrees
resolution = 30  # meters per pixel 
scale = resolution / 111320.0 # degrees per pixel for crs=4326

# ### Landsat Band Summary 
# The following list of bands will be loaded by the Open Data Cube (ODC) stac command:<br>
# We will use two load commands to separate the RGB data from the Surface Temperature data.<br><br>
# Band 2 = blue = 30m<br>
# Band 3 = green = 30m<br>
# Band 4 = red = 30m<br>
# Band 5 = nir08 (near infrared) = 30m<br>
# Band 11 = Surface Temperature = lwir11 = 100m

# %%

    items,

# ### Scaling Datasets
# Landsat Collection-2 Level-2 products require scaling before creating valid output products. <br>
# Scale factors for the RGB and NIR bands differ from scale factors for the Surface Temperature band.<br>

# Scale Factors for the RGB and NIR bands 
scale1 = 0.0000275

data1 = data1.astype(float) * scale1 + offset1

# Scale Factors for the Surface Temperature band
scale2 = 0.00341802 
offset2 = 149.0 
kelvin_celsius = 273.15 # convert from Kelvin to Celsius

# ### View RGB (real color) images from the time series
# You will notice that some of the scenes have clouds and some of the scenes have missing data due to scene boundary issues. Since Landsat is a descending orbit path across the equator, the time of acquisition for the scenes below is about 11:30am local time (note the time on the image is UTC time). Also, these images are merely for quick review and are not scaled correctly to reflect the proper Lat-Lon ratios. 

# %%
plot_data = data1[["red","green","blue"]].to_array()

# %% [markdown]
# ### Output Products
# 
# We will pick the best the best scene (no clouds, no missing data) to build our output products. This will not require any median filtering calculations as we will just pick one date from the time series. Finally, the numbering for these scenes starts at ZERO and goes from the top-left across the rows to reach the total number of scenes in the data array shown above. 

# %%
# Pick one of the scenes above (numbering starts with 0)
scene = 2

# %%
# Plot an RGB Real Color Image for a single date

# The <b>Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)</b> is used to measure the "greenness" of vegetation and has a range of 0.0 to 1.0. Low values (0.0 to 0.25) reflect a lack of vegetation (bare soil, urban, water), middle values (0.25 to 0.6) reflect grasslands or croplands in their growing state, and high values (0.6 to 1.0) reflect dense vegetation such as trees or croplands at their peak vegetation state. Such information can be relevant to modeling urban heating as the proximity to vegetation or "green space" can mitigate urban heating. The equation uses two spectral bands where: <b>NDVI = (NIR-Red) / (NIR+Red).

# %%
# Calculate NDVI for the median mosaic
ndvi_data = (data1.isel(time=scene).nir08-data1.isel(time=scene).red)/(data1.isel(time=scene).nir08+data1.isel(time=scene).red)
