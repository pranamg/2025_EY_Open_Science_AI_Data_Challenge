### Feature Engineering  

**Expand and refine input features:** The current three features likely miss important predictors of UHI. Sentinel-2 provides 13 spectral bands from visible to shortwave infrared ([Urban Heat Island mapping with combined Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations | Terrascope](https://terrascope.be/en/cases/urban-heat-island-mapping-combined-sentinel-2-and-sentinel-3-observations#:~:text=BLUE%20through%20SWIR%20channels,using%20the%20method%20from%20Gao)), so consider including additional bands that capture urban materials and moisture (e.g. visible bands for built surfaces, SWIR bands B11/B12 for impervious surfaces and moisture content). These bands can improve correlation with land surface temperature ([Urban Heat Island mapping with combined Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations | Terrascope](https://terrascope.be/en/cases/urban-heat-island-mapping-combined-sentinel-2-and-sentinel-3-observations#:~:text=BLUE%20through%20SWIR%20channels,using%20the%20method%20from%20Gao)). Derive **additional indices** beyond NDVI to represent urban characteristics. Notably, research shows the **Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI)** and **Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)** are strongly linked to UHI intensity ([A Remote Sensing Approach for Surface Urban Heat Island Modeling in a Tropical Colombian City Using Regression Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/21/4256#:~:text=observe%20that%20the%20main%20contributing,to%20derive%20the%20SUHI%20model)). In one study, NDBI and NDWI were the top predictors of LST (correlations ~0.89 in magnitude), outperforming NDVI ([A Remote Sensing Approach for Surface Urban Heat Island Modeling in a Tropical Colombian City Using Regression Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/21/4256#:~:text=observe%20that%20the%20main%20contributing,to%20derive%20the%20SUHI%20model)). Including such indices can capture the presence of built surfaces (NDBI) and moisture/vegetation (NDWI), which are key drivers of UHI ([A Remote Sensing Approach for Surface Urban Heat Island Modeling in a Tropical Colombian City Using Regression Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/21/4256#:~:text=vegetation%20cover%20model%20using%20Sentinel,of%20the%20new%20SUHI%20model)) ([A Remote Sensing Approach for Surface Urban Heat Island Modeling in a Tropical Colombian City Using Regression Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/21/4256#:~:text=observe%20that%20the%20main%20contributing,to%20derive%20the%20SUHI%20model)). You might also incorporate **Land Surface Temperature (LST)** itself if available (e.g. from a thermal sensor or a downscaled product). For example, combining Sentinel-3 thermal data with Sentinel-2 reflectance has been used to produce high-resolution LST maps ([Urban Heat Island mapping with combined Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations | Terrascope](https://terrascope.be/en/cases/urban-heat-island-mapping-combined-sentinel-2-and-sentinel-3-observations#:~:text=application%20which%20combines%20Sentinel,Discover%20more%20about%20these%20high)), which could serve as a feature or validation target.  

**Use domain knowledge for new features:** Calculate features that encode urban structure – for instance, an **impervious surface fraction** or urban cover percentage around each location. This was effectively used as a predictor in an UHI study (denoted as “PUC”) alongside NDVI/NDWI/NDBI, yielding a high R² (~0.82) in explaining LST variability ([A Remote Sensing Approach for Surface Urban Heat Island Modeling in a Tropical Colombian City Using Regression Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/21/4256#:~:text=was%20removed,MLR%20model%20outcomes%20as%20follows)). Other candidates include the **Normalized Difference Built-up Area Index**, **Normalized Difference Moisture Index**, or even texture measures (like the variance of NDVI in a neighborhood). Each derived feature should be evaluated for relevance (e.g. via correlation or feature importance). Applying a **feature selection** process is wise when many features are added. Techniques such as correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) can identify redundant variables. In fact, one UHI modeling approach employed PCA to distill multivariate satellite data into principal components before regression ([A Remote Sensing Approach for Surface Urban Heat Island Modeling in a Tropical Colombian City Using Regression Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/21/4256#:~:text=study%2C%20Land%20Surface%20Temperature%20,highest%20impact%20are%20the%20Normalized)). This ensured the most informative combinations of bands/indices were used. You can also leverage feature importance from a preliminary Random Forest or use algorithms like Boruta to confirm which bands/indices most influence the UHI index. By enriching the feature set with well-chosen spectral bands and indices – and pruning irrelevant ones – the model can capture more of the variance in UHI. Research consistently finds that a richer set of remote sensing indices (vegetation, water, built-up, etc.) leads to better UHI predictions ([A Remote Sensing Approach for Surface Urban Heat Island Modeling in a Tropical Colombian City Using Regression Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/21/4256#:~:text=,Extraction%20of%20Contributing%20Factors)) ([A Remote Sensing Approach for Surface Urban Heat Island Modeling in a Tropical Colombian City Using Regression Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/21/4256#:~:text=observe%20that%20the%20main%20contributing,to%20derive%20the%20SUHI%20model)).  

### Data Preprocessing  

**Improve data quality and consistency:** Proper preprocessing of the satellite data will ensure the model isn’t learning from noise. One key step is to use **atmospherically corrected, cloud-free imagery**. For instance, generating a composite image (e.g. a median of several days) can remove cloud contamination and smooth out noise ([Urban Heat Island mapping with combined Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations | Terrascope](https://terrascope.be/en/cases/urban-heat-island-mapping-combined-sentinel-2-and-sentinel-3-observations#:~:text=BLUE%20through%20SWIR%20channels,using%20the%20method%20from%20Gao)). In practice, a “10-day cloud-free Sentinel-2 composite” was used to get reliable reflectance inputs for an LST model ([Urban Heat Island mapping with combined Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations | Terrascope](https://terrascope.be/en/cases/urban-heat-island-mapping-combined-sentinel-2-and-sentinel-3-observations#:~:text=BLUE%20through%20SWIR%20channels,using%20the%20method%20from%20Gao)). If only a single date is available, apply cloud masks and possibly interpolate over small cloud gaps to avoid missing data. Make sure all bands are co-registered and resampled to a common resolution (e.g. 10 m) so that each feature aligns spatially with the UHI target points.  

**Handle missing values and outliers:** Check for any missing or invalid feature values in your dataset. For example, NDVI computation can produce infinities or NaNs (when the sum of NIR and red is zero); these should be replaced or removed ([Urban Heat Island (UHI) Sample Benchmark Notebook_V5.md](file://file-57pNRvynKY6DRZMj8BLs8J#:~:text=Calculate%20NDVI%20,Replace%20infinities%20with%20NaN)). In the sample code, infinities were turned to NaNs for NDVI ([Urban Heat Island (UHI) Sample Benchmark Notebook_V5.md](file://file-57pNRvynKY6DRZMj8BLs8J#:~:text=Calculate%20NDVI%20,Replace%20infinities%20with%20NaN)) – you should then impute these (using mean or a neighborhood value) or drop those instances to prevent errors. Outlier detection is also important: unusually high or low reflectance values (perhaps from sensor error or extreme materials) can skew the model. Remove or cap such outliers based on domain knowledge (for instance, NDVI should generally lie in [-1,1]; reflectance should be within physical limits). Smoothing techniques can help reduce high-frequency noise – e.g. apply a small median filter on the band data or average features over a few neighboring pixels if the spatial resolution is much finer than the UHI phenomena. Researchers sometimes **aggregate data** in space or time to reduce noise; one study suggests that aggregating remote-sensing pixels can decrease the number of missing data and outliers ([Filling missing data and smoothing altered data in satellite imagery ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334832134_Filling_missing_data_and_smoothing_altered_data_in_satellite_imagery_with_a_spatial_functional_procedure#:~:text=,2%29)). Similarly, averaging multiple dates or using temporal filters (if multi-date NDVI is available) can iron out noise in vegetation signals ([Filling missing data and smoothing altered data in satellite imagery ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334832134_Filling_missing_data_and_smoothing_altered_data_in_satellite_imagery_with_a_spatial_functional_procedure#:~:text=,2%29)).  

**Feature scaling and normalization:** While tree-based models like Random Forest are invariant to monotonic scaling (they split on feature thresholds rather than using distances), other algorithms benefit greatly from scaled inputs. If you experiment with models like SVM or neural networks, apply standardization or normalization to the features. Feature scaling puts all inputs on a comparable scale so that no single feature dominates due to units ([Why feature scaling (or standardization) is important in machine ...](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/why-feature-scaling-or-standardization-is-important-in-machine-learning-aaba175b664#:~:text=Why%20feature%20scaling%20,or%20control%20the%20trained%20model)). For example, NDVI is in [-1,1] while reflectance bands might range 0–10,000 (if in digital number format) – scaling the latter to 0–1 or standardizing to mean 0, std 1 is prudent. **Note:** For Random Forest specifically, scaling is *not* strictly required ([Does Random Forest Need Feature Scaling or Normalization? | Forecastegy](https://forecastegy.com/posts/does-random-forest-need-feature-scaling-or-normalization/#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20using%20Random,scaling%20or%20normalizing%20your%20features)). Tree-based models handle unscaled heterogeneous features well ([Does Random Forest Need Feature Scaling or Normalization? | Forecastegy](https://forecastegy.com/posts/does-random-forest-need-feature-scaling-or-normalization/#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20using%20Random,scaling%20or%20normalizing%20your%20features)), so prioritize scaling for alternative models. Nevertheless, it’s good practice to have a consistent data preprocessing pipeline so you can easily plug in different algorithms. In summary, clean the data (remove clouds/noise), ensure alignment and meaningful ranges, and apply transformations (log, normalization) if a feature’s distribution warrants it. These steps will provide the model with high-quality, comparable inputs, which is crucial for improving accuracy.  

### Alternative Models  

**Try more powerful regression algorithms:** A Random Forest is a strong baseline, but exploring other models may yield better predictive performance. **Gradient Boosting Machines** like **XGBoost** or **LightGBM** often outperform RF in structured data tasks due to their ability to minimize errors sequentially. For instance, in a land surface temperature downscaling comparison, an XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy (R² ~0.83–0.89) outperforming both Random Forest and a neural network across test areas ([Frontiers | A comparative analysis of five land surface temperature downscaling methods in plateau mountainous areas](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2024.1488711/full#:~:text=the%20performance%20of%20machine%20learning,LST%20in%20plateau%20mountainous%20areas)). The boosted model could capture complex nonlinear relationships and interactions that improved prediction of LST ([Frontiers | A comparative analysis of five land surface temperature downscaling methods in plateau mountainous areas](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2024.1488711/full#:~:text=the%20performance%20of%20machine%20learning,LST%20in%20plateau%20mountainous%20areas)). You should consider training an XGBoost regressor (or its efficient variant LightGBM) using the expanded feature set – these models handle many features well, have built-in feature importance, and can even deal with missing values internally.  

**Support Vector Regression (SVR)** with a nonlinear kernel is another option, as it can model complex functions in a high-dimensional feature space. SVR has been used in remote sensing regression tasks with success, though it may require careful kernel and parameter tuning. Some studies find SVR performance on par with Random Forest; for example, one experiment showed RF and SVR yielding **marginally different results**, with RF slightly ahead in accuracy ([Using Linear Regression, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machine with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Multispectral Images to Predict Canopy Nitrogen Weight in Corn](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/13/2071#:~:text=time,images%20acquired%20at%20different%20dates)). The choice may come down to data size (SVR can be slower on large datasets) and the ease of obtaining good hyperparameters. If tried, make sure to scale inputs (SVR is sensitive to feature scale) and experiment with radial basis function (RBF) kernels for nonlinear patterns.  

**Neural networks** could potentially capture underlying relationships given enough data. A simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with hidden layers might improve R² if the relationship between bands and UHI is highly nonlinear. However, neural nets require larger datasets to generalize well; if your training sample is limited (e.g., a few hundred points), an ensemble tree method might be more reliable. In one UHI-related study, a feed-forward neural network was tested alongside tree models, but the tree-based XGBoost still performed best ([Frontiers | A comparative analysis of five land surface temperature downscaling methods in plateau mountainous areas](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2024.1488711/full#:~:text=areas,was%20analyzed%20from%20the%20perspective)) ([Frontiers | A comparative analysis of five land surface temperature downscaling methods in plateau mountainous areas](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2024.1488711/full#:~:text=the%20performance%20of%20machine%20learning,LST%20in%20plateau%20mountainous%20areas)). This suggests that for tabular satellite-derived features, gradient boosting may edge out a basic neural net. That said, if you have the ability to incorporate *spatial structure* via a CNN (by feeding image patches around each point), a deep learning model could learn local patterns relevant to UHI (e.g. shapes of greenery or buildings). This would be a more involved approach, essentially moving beyond point prediction to image-based prediction. As an intermediate step, you could also try **ensemble learning** by combining multiple models. For example, train an RF, an XGBoost, and an SVR, then average their predictions or use a simple linear blend. Ensembles often improve robustness, since different algorithms may compensate for each other’s errors. In summary, don’t limit to Random Forest – **experiment with gradient boosting** (commonly superior in structured data ([Frontiers | A comparative analysis of five land surface temperature downscaling methods in plateau mountainous areas](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2024.1488711/full#:~:text=the%20performance%20of%20machine%20learning,LST%20in%20plateau%20mountainous%20areas))), **kernel SVR**, and potentially **neural networks**. Evaluate each with cross-validation to see which offers the best R² on unseen data. The best model (or an ensemble of models) can then be chosen for final deployment.  

### Hyperparameter Tuning  

**Optimize model settings for better fit:** The default hyperparameters of a Random Forest (e.g. 100 trees, unlimited depth) are not guaranteed to be optimal for your problem. Systematically tuning them can notably improve performance ([python - How to improve my regression models results more accurate in random forest regression - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72355804/how-to-improve-my-regression-models-results-more-accurate-in-random-forest-regre#:~:text=in%20order%20to%20get%20better,try%20to%20focus%20on%20these)). Key hyperparameters to focus on for RF include ([python - How to improve my regression models results more accurate in random forest regression - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72355804/how-to-improve-my-regression-models-results-more-accurate-in-random-forest-regre#:~:text=in%20order%20to%20get%20better,try%20to%20focus%20on%20these)):  

- **n_estimators** – number of trees in the forest. More trees can improve performance (up to a point) by reducing variance. Try increasing beyond the default (e.g. 200, 300, 500 trees) and monitor if the OOB error or CV score improves.  
- **max_depth** – maximum depth of each tree. Limiting depth can prevent overfitting. Very deep trees (depth  None in sklearn means no limit) will learn training data extremely well but might not generalize. Test a range (e.g. depth 5, 10, 20, None) to see what yields the best validation score. If you observe overfitting, shallow trees (smaller max_depth) or a larger **min_samples_leaf** can help ([machine learning - Which hyperparameters should I choose to tune for different ML models? - Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/626744/which-hyperparameters-should-i-choose-to-tune-for-different-ml-models#:~:text=You%20can%20try%20tune%20max_depth,underfitting%20you%20can%20increase%20max_depth)).  
- **max_features** – the number of features considered when splitting a node. Sklearn’s default ‘auto’ (which is sqrt of total features for regression) can be tuned. Sometimes using a higher fraction of features per split (or even all features) can improve a regression R², especially if features are limited. Try values like “sqrt” (default), 50% of features, 100% of features, etc., and see which yields the best result ([machine learning - Which hyperparameters should I choose to tune for different ML models? - Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/626744/which-hyperparameters-should-i-choose-to-tune-for-different-ml-models#:~:text=max_features%20is%20another%20good%20one,sqrt)).  
- **min_samples_split** and **min_samples_leaf** – these control the minimum samples required to split a node or to form a leaf. Increasing these values forces the tree to consider larger sample groups before splitting, which can reduce overfitting by making leaves more general. For example, requiring at least 5 samples in a leaf can avoid splits on very sparse data patterns. Tune these parameters if your RF is overfitting (high training R², low test R²).  
- **bootstrap** – whether to sample data with replacement for each tree. This is True by default (standard bootstrap aggregating). In some cases, turning it off (sampling without replacement) or adjusting the sample fraction can affect performance. It’s usually left True, but it’s a parameter to be aware of ([python - How to improve my regression models results more accurate in random forest regression - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72355804/how-to-improve-my-regression-models-results-more-accurate-in-random-forest-regre#:~:text=1,with%20or%20without%20replacement)).  

Use a **grid search or random search** over these hyperparameters to find the best combination. For example, a grid could try multiple values for each (as mentioned above) and evaluate via cross-validation. Scikit-learn’s `GridSearchCV` makes this straightforward but can be computationally expensive if the grid is large. An alternative is **random search**, which often finds a good set of parameters with far fewer iterations than a full grid, especially when some parameters are not very sensitive ([machine learning - Which hyperparameters should I choose to tune for different ML models? - Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/626744/which-hyperparameters-should-i-choose-to-tune-for-different-ml-models#:~:text=different%20model%20architectures%20can%20be,wall%20and%20sees%20what%20sticks)). Even more efficient is **Bayesian optimization** for hyperparameters. Tools like Optuna or scikit-optimize use Bayesian methods to smartly explore the parameter space, honing in on promising regions instead of blindly sampling ([Optimization of random forest model using optuna - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mustafagerme/optimization-of-random-forest-model-using-optuna#:~:text=Optimization%20of%20random%20forest%20model,configuration%20in%20the%20shortest)). This can save time and possibly find better settings. For instance, Optuna can optimize an objective (validation R²) by suggesting parameter sets, and it has been successfully used to tune Random Forests and other models ([Optimization of random forest model using optuna - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mustafagerme/optimization-of-random-forest-model-using-optuna#:~:text=Optimization%20of%20random%20forest%20model,configuration%20in%20the%20shortest)). Whichever search strategy you choose, **ensure proper validation**: use cross-validation in the tuning process so that each candidate is fairly evaluated. It’s also wise to do a final evaluation on an independent test set after tuning, to confirm that the improvements aren’t just from overfitting the validation folds. In practice, tuning RF hyperparameters (especially n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_leaf, max_features) can substantially lift the R² ([python - How to improve my regression models results more accurate in random forest regression - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72355804/how-to-improve-my-regression-models-results-more-accurate-in-random-forest-regre#:~:text=in%20order%20to%20get%20better,try%20to%20focus%20on%20these)). The model becomes more tailored to the data – for example, an optimized RF might need fewer deep splits if the signal is noisy, or many more trees if the variance is high. By systematically searching the hyperparameter space (using grid search or a more advanced method), you’ll likely push the R² above the current 0.37.  

### Cross-Validation Strategies  

**Robustly assess model performance:** Relying on a single train-test split can be misleading, especially with spatial data. Employing cross-validation (CV) will give a more reliable estimate of generalization. A common approach is **k-fold cross-validation** (e.g. 5-fold or 10-fold), wherein the data is split into *k* subsets and the model is trained *k* times, each time leaving out one subset as the validation fold. This yields *k* performance measures (R², RMSE, etc.) that can be averaged for a robust estimate ([Cooling Effect of Green Spaces on Urban Heat Island in a Chinese ...](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c11048#:~:text=Cooling%20Effect%20of%20Green%20Spaces,was%20used%20as%20an)). For instance, using 10-fold CV and reporting the average R² is a standard practice in UHI modeling to ensure the model isn’t overfitting one particular split ([Cooling Effect of Green Spaces on Urban Heat Island in a Chinese ...](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c11048#:~:text=Cooling%20Effect%20of%20Green%20Spaces,was%20used%20as%20an)). Make sure to shuffle your data (if appropriate) before splitting so that folds are representative of the whole.  

However, with spatial data like UHI, **spatial autocorrelation** is a concern – nearby points can have similar UHI values, which violates the assumption of i.i.d. samples in regular CV. If your training points are spatially clustered, a random CV split might leak information (the model could get easy hints by training on neighbors of the test points). To address this, consider **spatial cross-validation** techniques ([Spatial Cross-Validation in Geographic Data Analysis - Medium](https://medium.com/data-and-beyond/spatial-cross-validation-in-geographic-data-analysis-1579090dedf5#:~:text=Spatial%20cross,to%20handle%20spatially%20correlated%20data)). Spatial CV creates folds based on location rather than random sampling. One approach is **leave-one-area-out**: for example, train on Bronx points and test on Manhattan points, then vice versa, if those are distinct regions in the data. More generally, you can cluster the points spatially (e.g. using a grid or clustering algorithm) and use those clusters as CV folds. This way, each fold is geographically separated from the others. As a result, the validation simulates how the model would perform when predicting in a new area it hasn’t seen during training ([Spatial Cross-Validation in Geographic Data Analysis - Medium](https://medium.com/data-and-beyond/spatial-cross-validation-in-geographic-data-analysis-1579090dedf5#:~:text=Spatial%20cross,to%20handle%20spatially%20correlated%20data)). Brenning (2012) formalized this as spatial cross-validation for remote sensing models, demonstrating that it provides more realistic error estimates when data are spatially correlated ([Spatial Clustering Cross-Validation — spatial_clustering_cv • spatialsample](https://spatialsample.tidymodels.org/reference/spatial_clustering_cv.html#:~:text=A.%20Brenning%2C%20%22Spatial%20cross,5375%2C%20doi%3A%2010.1109%2FIGARSS.2012.6352393)). In practice, implementing spatial CV can be as simple as withholding all points within a certain radius or tile as the test fold. There are libraries (in R, `sperrorest`, and in Python, `sklearn` with custom CV iterators) to facilitate this. The takeaway is to ensure your CV strategy aligns with the problem structure: **if spatial patterns exist, use CV that respects space**. This will prevent overly optimistic performance metrics and help tune the model for true generalization.  

Additionally, use CV during hyperparameter tuning (nested CV) to avoid overfitting the validation process. For example, in a 5-fold CV, each split’s model could itself be tuned by an inner CV on the training portion. While this increases computation, it guards against selecting hyperparameters that only work for a specific split. Once you have a final model, validate it on a held-out test set (or via cross-validation with all data) to report the final R². Given the relatively low current R² (0.37), a rigorous cross-validation protocol will be important to track genuine improvements as you try new features and models. It will give you confidence that any gain (say R² increases to 0.5 or 0.6) is real and not an artifact of a lucky split. In summary, **use k-fold CV for baseline evaluation**, and if spatial dependency is strong, **adopt spatial CV** to properly assess generalization performance ([Spatial Cross-Validation in Geographic Data Analysis - Medium](https://medium.com/data-and-beyond/spatial-cross-validation-in-geographic-data-analysis-1579090dedf5#:~:text=Spatial%20cross,to%20handle%20spatially%20correlated%20data)). This ensures the improvements you implement translate to better predictive power in practice, not just on paper.  

### Spatial Feature Extraction  

**Capture spatial context without explicit coordinates:** Instead of using raw latitude/longitude (which the model might inadvertently learn as an ID for certain areas, hurting generalization), derive features that represent the *spatial environment* of each point. One effective idea is to use **moving window statistics** on the raster data. For each location, compute features like the mean, max, or standard deviation of certain bands or indices in a surrounding area (e.g. a 100 m or 500 m radius). This captures the local context – for instance, a point in the middle of a large park will have a high mean NDVI in its neighborhood, whereas a point in downtown will have a high mean NDBI (built-up index) around it. These context features can help the model distinguish micro-environments. **Spatial smoothing of input features** is essentially adding low-frequency information: you could create a blurred version of the NDVI layer and sample those values to represent regional greenness, or a density map of buildings. Such features incorporate the influence of nearby land covers on the UHI at a location.  

In particular, **proximity-based features** are useful. Calculate the distance from each point to important landscape features – e.g. distance to the city center, distance to the nearest large water body, or distance to major green spaces. Urban heat island intensity often increases toward city centers and decreases outward ([AMT - A high-resolution monitoring approach of canopy urban heat island using a random forest model and multi-platform observations](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/15/735/2022/#:~:text=coefficient%20between%20the%20predicted%20and,CUHII%20provides%20scientific%20support%20for)). In one case, canopy UHI intensity was found to diminish with distance from downtown, correlating with a drop in built-up fraction and anthropogenic heat ([AMT - A high-resolution monitoring approach of canopy urban heat island using a random forest model and multi-platform observations](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/15/735/2022/#:~:text=coefficient%20between%20the%20predicted%20and,CUHII%20provides%20scientific%20support%20for)). Including a “distance to city center” feature (or a radial coordinate if the city center is known) can let the model learn this gradient, without hard-coding lat/long. Similarly, distance to water or coast can capture cooling effects of water bodies, and distance to parks can capture cooling by vegetation. Ensure these distances are normalized (so that 0 is meaningful as “at the feature” and larger values make sense to the model).

**Spatially aggregated land cover features** are another approach. You can compute the fraction of different land use types in a buffer around the point (e.g. % vegetation, % impervious, % water in a 100 m circle). This effectively summarizes the local land cover mix. For example, an **impervious surface fraction** (percentage of built-up area) around each location is highly informative for UHI – areas with more concrete and asphalt tend to be hotter. In a high-resolution UHI study, researchers used impervious surface area and green cover around weather stations as input features to predict air temperature, achieving a good correspondence (r ~0.73) between predicted and observed temps ([AMT - A high-resolution monitoring approach of canopy urban heat island using a random forest model and multi-platform observations](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/15/735/2022/#:~:text=forest%20%28RF%29%20model,negatively%20correlated%20with%20CUHII%2C%20and)). This suggests that incorporating such aggregated measures (which you can derive from Sentinel-2 or auxiliary data like urban maps) will help the model account for the urban morphology around each point. Likewise, you could incorporate **surface albedo** as a feature (bright vs dark surfaces affect heat absorption) or **building height/density** if available (perhaps from LiDAR or OpenStreetMap), since urban canyon effects influence UHI. Many of these factors were used in that study’s Random Forest model (albedo, land cover types, impervious fraction, etc.) to successfully map urban air temperatures ([AMT - A high-resolution monitoring approach of canopy urban heat island using a random forest model and multi-platform observations](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/15/735/2022/#:~:text=forest%20%28RF%29%20model,negatively%20correlated%20with%20CUHII%2C%20and)).

**Leverage spatial autocorrelation constructively:** If nearby UHI index values tend to be similar, the model could benefit from knowing something about its neighbors. One advanced technique is **geostatistical smoothing** of model outputs – for example, use the Random Forest to predict UHI for all points, then apply a spatial filter or kriging on those predictions to enforce spatial coherence. A known hybrid approach is **Random Forest residual kriging (RFRK)**, where the RF captures relationships with predictors, and any remaining spatially-correlated residual is interpolated by kriging ([Hybrid modelling of random forests and kriging with sentinel-2A ...](https://www.x-mol.com/paper/1344391971362058240#:~:text=ABSTRACT%20Herein%2C%20a%20random,infrared)). This can improve the spatial smoothness and accuracy of predictions. In the context of downscaling thermal images, such RF+kriging methods yielded finer resolution temperature maps by adding spatial dependency learned from residuals ([Hybrid modelling of random forests and kriging with sentinel-2A ...](https://www.x-mol.com/paper/1344391971362058240#:~:text=ABSTRACT%20Herein%2C%20a%20random,infrared)). Implementing kriging requires geostatistics knowledge and is a post-processing step, but even a simpler approach like averaging a prediction with the mean of its spatial neighbors could reduce random error. If using such techniques, be cautious not to “leak” true test data into predictions – only use neighbor information from the training set or within the prediction process for new points.

In summary, aim to **encode the spatial effects via features** rather than raw coordinates. Use neighborhood statistics (e.g. mean NDVI around the point), **relative position features** (distance to key urban features), and possibly **spatial smoothing** of predictions. By doing so, the model can learn the influence of the surrounding area on a location’s UHI. This is crucial because UHI is inherently a spatial phenomenon – it’s not just the pixel’s value that matters, but the context (continuous built-up areas vs isolated hotspots, etc.). Adopting these spatial features will allow the model to capture patterns like “locations embedded in large urban sprawls tend to have higher UHI” or “points next to water/parks are cooler,” without explicitly giving it latitude/longitude. Such approaches have been shown to improve model explanatory power for UHI/SUHI studies ([A Remote Sensing Approach for Surface Urban Heat Island Modeling in a Tropical Colombian City Using Regression Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/21/4256#:~:text=observe%20that%20the%20main%20contributing,to%20derive%20the%20SUHI%20model)) ([AMT - A high-resolution monitoring approach of canopy urban heat island using a random forest model and multi-platform observations](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/15/735/2022/#:~:text=forest%20%28RF%29%20model,negatively%20correlated%20with%20CUHII%2C%20and)). Combining strong predictors (spectral indices, etc.) with spatial context features should markedly improve the Random Forest’s R² beyond the current baseline. Each of the enhancements above – richer features, better preprocessing, model tuning, and spatial techniques – will incrementally push the performance, and together they can lead to a significantly more accurate UHI prediction model.

## You asked-03

I have received the following files as part of the dataset. I need your help in providing a plan of action for testing out all the suggestions you have provided above in a methodical manner. Please let me know if you want me to upload any of these files received as part of dataset for context or reference purposes.

1. Temperature data (Training_data_uhi_index.csv): Data was collected by CAPA Strategies using a ground traverse (Figures 1 and 2) with vehicles and bicycles on a single day in the summer of 2021. This data collection effort resulted in 11,229 data points which will be the focus for this data challenge. - Figure 1. Ground-level temperature data was collected by CAPA Strategies and community volunteers using temperature recording devices mounted to cars and bikes. This data collection campaign was part of the international “Heat Watch” program. Credit: CAPA Strategies, LLC. Figure 2. Data was collected across Manhattan and the Bronx in New York City on July 24, 2021, between 3:00 pm and 4:00 pm. The data (11,229 points) was converted to a UHI Index for the purpose of this data challenge. The image above shows areas of lower UHI index values (cool spots) in yellow and areas of higher UHI index values (hot spots) in dark red. For this challenge, we have created a unique UHI index for every data point location. This index reflects the local temperature at the data point location compared to the city's average temperature across all data points during the time window of the data collection. Though this is not a perfect approach to modelling the complex urban heating dynamics of a city, it will provide a reasonably accurate model of urban heat islands in the city at the time of day consistent with the data collection. In an ideal situation, time series data would be collected at thousands of locations across the city and weather data (e.g., wind speed, wind direction, solar flux) would be added to the model to yield more accuracy and allow for consideration of natural variability. UHI Index = (Temperature at a given location) / (Mean temperature for all locations) Note: UHI index calculations only used data within a 1-hour data collection window. The chosen UHI index serves as a crucial metric for assessing the intensity of heat within different urban zones of the city. For comparison, most literature calculates a UHI index based on temperature differences between inner city locations and rural locations far outside of the city. Since we did not have data from rural locations, we created a unique UHI index that reflects the variability of temperatures within our collected dataset and time collection window. As an example, a UHI index value of 1.0 suggests the local temperature is the same as the mean temperature of all collected data points. UHI index values above 1.0 are consistent with hotspots above mean temperature values and UHI index values below 1.0 are consistent with cooler locations in the city. Participants will use their models to predict these UHI values across the city. Figure 3 shows a histogram of UHI values for the data challenge. The range of collected temperatures had a maximum difference of 7.5 Degrees-Fahrenheit (4.2 Degrees- Celsius). Though this is much lower than known global extremes (10 Degrees-Celsius difference), the collected data does allow for the identification of urban heat islands. When converted to UHI index values (range of 0.956 to 1.046), this yielded a 9% variation in UHI values across the data collection region.
2. Building Footprints (Building_Footprint.kml): Many studies suggest that the density of buildings in a city influences ground temperatures and ultimately contribute to the UHI issue. [Reference 3] This effect is typically driven by buildings blocking the flow of air and adding waste heat. For this challenge, we have provided a building footprint dataset. Such information could be used in your digital model as a feature that drives local urban heating. Figure 4. Higher building density is known to increase local air temperatures and contribute to the UHI effect. Data challenge participants will be given building footprint data for consideration in their digital models.
3. Satellite Data (Sentinel2_GeoTIFF.ipynb and Landsat_LST.ipynb): Satellite data can be quite beneficial for understanding the location and severity of urban heat islands. Missions such as NASA’s Landsat and European Space Agency’s (ESA) Sentinel-2 provide continuous global coverage at regular revisit rates and open and free access to the datasets on cloud computing frameworks. These datasets provide a unique look at urban areas and often measure regions not covered by in-situ measurements. But these datasets also have limitations that must be considered when using them for UHI models. For example, these optical satellites cannot penetrate clouds or vegetative cover, so this often leads to data gaps and decreased data quality. In addition, these satellites have consistent acquisition times near the middle of the day which does not usually coincide with collected ground data or the times of maximum urban heating. So, some of these factors should be considered when using satellite data in UHI models. The launch of the European Copernicus Sentinel-2 missions in 2015 and 2017 provides optical data at 10-meter spatial resolution and a revisit every 10 days with one mission and every 5 days with two missions. This free and open data is readily available from the Microsoft Planetary Computer (<https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog>). But optical data cannot penetrate clouds, so it is necessary to filter out clouds or select scenes that have very low levels of cloud cover. For this challenge, we have provided a sample Sentinel-2 Python notebook that selects low-cloud scenes and creates a median mosaic without cloud contamination. This product can be used to assess the impacts of vegetation extent, water, or urban density on urban heating. It is well known [Reference 4] that proximity to vegetation (green space), proximity to water, and local urban density contribute to the effects of urban heating. Figure 5 shows an example of a Sentinel-2 mosaic product illustrating the spatial variation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over our data challenge region (shown in white). Figure 5. Sentinel-2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over the data challenge region (New York City). This product is based on a median mosaic from June-August 2021 which removes cloud contamination. Areas of light green or dark green are consistent with the presence of vegetation. Areas of dark red are consistent with dense urban environments or water. This information can be used in your digital model as vegetation, urban density and water can impact local urban heating. NASA’s Landsat mission has been in continuous operation since 1984. This mission includes a unique thermal infrared sensor that can measure Land Surface Temperature (LST). With two missions available at any given time, this data is freely available every 8 days for the entire world from the Microsoft Planetary Computer (see link above). This data has been widely used to assess UHI variations in many studies, but its limitations should be considered. For example, LST only measures the surface temperature of what can be seen from space. That includes tops of buildings, open streets or open land areas. It does not reflect the air temperature conditions near the surface where humans exist. The coarse resolution of the LST product (100 meters) often mixes surface responses from tops of buildings and open roads or land which adds error to the data. In addition, the accuracy of the LST data depends strongly on corrections for atmospheric effects and an accurate estimate of surface emissivity. Finally, one needs to consider the timing of the data product. For our data challenge case, no Landsat data is available on the same day as the ground data collection. Also, the Landsat data acquisition time is about 11:30 am which does not exactly match the time of the day when ground traverse data was collected (3:00 pm to 4:00 pm). For this challenge, we have provided a sample Landsat LST Python notebook that selects a clear scene (June 16) close to the date of the ground data collection (July 24). This product  can be used to assess building surface and ground surface temperatures which may contribute to local air heating in a UHI model. Figure 6 shows an example of a Landsat LST product illustrating the spatial variation of surface temperatures over our data challenge region. Figure 6. Landsat Land Surface Temperature (LST) over the data challenge region (New York City) on June 16, 2021. Areas of red are consistent with high surface temperatures (above 40C) such as the tops of buildings with dark coatings and black pavement. Areas of blue are consistent with areas of lower surface temperature (below 30C) such as water and vegetation. The locations and severity of these extremes may be an important feature in a UHI model.
4. Local Weather Data (NY_Mesonet_Weather.xlsx):Local weather data can also be an important feature in a UHI model. For example, high wind speeds can cause mixing of near-surface air and reduce UHI intensity and variability. Wind direction can also impact localized heating as building configurations can block local mixing of near-surface air and cause increased urban heating. 
Finally, solar flux can be blocked by clouds or building configurations which could reduce local surface heating and near-surface air heating. For this challenge, we have provided a local weather dataset from the New York State Mesonet (<https://nysmesonet.org>). Two weather stations, located at the southern and northern ends of the ground traverse data region, collected near- surface data (2-meters height) every 5 minutes during the day. This data includes temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and solar flux. This data may be useful for your AI model.
5. Model Development and Evaluation (Submission_template.csv and UHI Experiment Sample Benchmark Notebook V5.ipynb): Participants will develop a machine learning / AI model [example in References 4 and 5] that can accurately predict UHI index values at specific locations in New York City. To get started, participants are provided with a sample benchmark Python notebook that will demonstrate a simple UHI prediction model. This sample model is designed to use UHI index data from the target dataset that was compiled from ground traverse data collected on July 24, 2021. Sentinel-2 satellite data spectral bands are used as the feature dataset in the sample model. The model uses a common 70/30 training and testing split to evaluate model performance. The sample model produces modest results to allow significant improvements by data challenge participants. Some suggestions for improved model performance include: consideration of additional datasets (Landsat LST, building footprints, weather), consideration of additional Sentinel-2 bands or spectral indices, proximity of satellite data features to data collection points, building density in proximity to data collection points, regression algorithms, and hyperparameter tuning. As a note, participants are allowed to use additional datasets for their model, provided those datasets are open and available to all public users and the source of such datasets are referenced in the model. In the end, participant models will be tested against known UHI index values (validation dataset) for a portion of the region that is not included in the target dataset. Predictions on the validation dataset shall be saved in a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file and uploaded to the challenge platform to get a score on the ranking board, which you can improve over the course of the challenge with subsequent model revisions and submissions.

  - Tune parameters such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `max_features`, `min_samples_leaf`, and `min_samples_split` using Grid Search or Random Search.  
  - Consider using Bayesian optimization (e.g., via Optuna) for a more efficient search.

- **Tuning Alternative Models:**  
  - For XGBoost/LightGBM, tune learning rate, max_depth, subsample ratio, and number of estimators.  
  - For SVR, optimize kernel parameters (e.g., gamma, C).  
  - Use nested cross-validation to ensure that hyperparameter tuning does not lead to overfitting.

---

Below is a step‐by‐step, methodical plan to test and integrate all the suggestions—using the additional datasets (temperature, building footprints, satellite products, and weather data) you’ve provided. This plan is designed to help you systematically improve your model’s performance and document each iteration:

---

### **Phase 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing**

1. **Data Inventory & Visualization**  
   - **Temperature Data (Training_data_uhi_index.csv):**  
     - Load the 11,229 data points and visualize the UHI index distribution (e.g., histogram and spatial scatter map).  
     - Check for outliers or anomalies in UHI values.
   - **Building Footprints (Building_Footprint.kml):**  
     - Load the KML file and visualize building distributions.  
     - Determine potential metrics (e.g., building density or impervious area) by creating buffers around the UHI points.
   - **Satellite Data (Sentinel-2 and Landsat LST):**  
     - Run the provided notebooks (Sentinel2_GeoTIFF.py and Landsat_LST.py) to generate GeoTIFFs and derived indices (NDVI, NDBI, NDWI).  
     - Confirm that cloud filtering and atmospheric corrections are appropriately applied.
   - **Weather Data (NY Mesonet Weather files):**  
     - Load and inspect the weather summary, Manhattan, and Bronx CSV files.  
     - Visualize time series of key variables (air temperature, wind speed/direction, solar flux) to understand temporal trends during the collection window.

2. **Data Cleaning and Alignment**  
   - **Spatial Alignment:**  
     - Ensure all datasets share a common coordinate reference system (e.g., EPSG:4326).  
     - Align the spatial extents: match the weather station locations, building footprints, and satellite-derived data with the UHI points.
   - **Missing/Erroneous Data Handling:**  
     - For computed indices (e.g., NDVI) and any derived weather features, address division errors or missing values (e.g., replacing infinities or NaNs).  
     - Use interpolation or filtering for any gaps.
   - **Temporal Alignment:**  
     - Since your ground data was collected between 3:00–4:00 pm, aggregate or interpolate the weather data to derive representative values (mean, max, etc.) for that period.

### **Phase 2: Feature Engineering**

1. **Enhance Satellite Features:**  
   - **Additional Spectral Indices:**  
     - Beyond NDVI (already computed), derive indices like NDBI and NDWI from the Sentinel-2 GeoTIFF.  
     - Consider using additional bands (e.g., SWIR) to capture urban materials and moisture.
   - **Spatial Aggregation:**  
     - Experiment with creating focal buffer statistics (e.g., mean, variance) for key bands or indices around each UHI data point.  
     - Test different buffer sizes (e.g., 50 m, 100 m, 150 m) to capture local context without tying the model to specific coordinates.

2. **Integrate Building Footprint Data:**  
   - **Building Density Metrics:**  
     - Calculate building density or impervious surface fraction within a set radius of each UHI point.  
     - These features will capture urban density effects on local temperatures.

3. **Weather Data Feature Extraction:**  
   - **Derive Relevant Weather Metrics:**  
     - Aggregate weather variables (wind speed, wind direction, solar flux) from the two stations over the data collection window.  
     - Compute additional derived features (e.g., heat index from air temperature and humidity, wind vector components) that might explain air mixing and localized cooling/heating.

4. **Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction:**  
   - **Correlation & Importance Analysis:**  
     - Use correlation matrices and feature importance from a baseline model (e.g., Random Forest) to assess the predictive power of each new feature.  
     - Consider PCA or other dimensionality reduction techniques if the feature space becomes large.

### **Phase 3: Model Training and Alternative Approaches**

1. **Baseline and Alternative Models:**  
   - **Baseline Model:**  
     - Re-run the current Random Forest model using the original three features to establish a baseline (R² ≈ 0.37).
   - **Test Alternative Models:**  
     - Implement alternative regression models such as XGBoost/LightGBM, SVR (with RBF kernel), and even simple neural networks (MLP).  
     - Consider ensemble methods (e.g., combining RF with XGBoost) to improve robustness.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
   - **Systematic Tuning:**  
     - For each model, especially Random Forest and XGBoost, perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., using Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian optimization with Optuna) on key parameters such as:
       - **Random Forest:** `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `max_features`, `min_samples_split`, and `min_samples_leaf`.
       - **XGBoost/LightGBM:** learning rate, tree depth, subsample ratio, and number of estimators.
   - **Nested Cross-Validation:**  
     - Use nested CV to avoid overfitting during hyperparameter tuning.

3. **Model Evaluation with Cross-Validation:**  
   - **Standard K-Fold CV:**  
     - Use 5- or 10-fold cross-validation to measure performance improvements objectively.
   - **Spatial Cross-Validation:**  
     - Implement a spatial CV scheme by splitting the data into geographical clusters (e.g., by borough or using clustering algorithms) to ensure the model generalizes spatially.
   - **Metrics:**  
     - Track performance using R², RMSE, and analyze error distributions to pinpoint areas for further improvement.

### **Phase 4: Iterative Testing and Analysis**

1. **Documentation and Experiment Tracking:**  
   - Keep detailed logs of experiments, including which features, models, and hyperparameters were tested.
   - Use version control (e.g., Git) and consider tools like MLflow for tracking model experiments and metrics.

2. **Visual Analysis:**  
   - Plot residuals and spatial prediction maps to visually assess where the model performs well or struggles.
   - Compare the spatial distribution of predictions against ground-truth UHI index values.

3. **Ensemble and Model Blending (if needed):**  
   - If individual models show complementary strengths, experiment with ensemble methods (weighted averages, stacking) to potentially boost overall accuracy.

---

### **Phase 5: Finalization and Deployment**

1. **Final Model Selection:**  
   - Choose the model (or ensemble) that shows the best performance across both standard and spatial CV metrics.
   - Validate the final model on the held-out submission set (using Submission_template.csv).

2. **Generate Final Predictions and Submission:**  
   - Produce the final prediction CSV.
   - Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing your methodology, key improvements, and final model performance.

3. **Documentation and Reporting:**  
   - Document the entire process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning, and validation strategies.
   - Create visualizations and summaries that clearly communicate your findings and improvements.

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Data Synchronization:** Ensure that the temporal aspects of the weather and satellite data match the time window of the ground data collection.
- **Reproducibility:** Save intermediate processed datasets and notebooks so that each experimental phase is reproducible.
- **Flexibility:** Since your model needs to be applicable in other scenarios/locations, focus on derived features (e.g., building density, spatial aggregation, relative distance measures) rather than absolute coordinates.
